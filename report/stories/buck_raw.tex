so as i sit down to eat from this spread that has been given in my honor i can't help but to f notice the two feelings that i'm having one i'm a little nervous two i'm very excited because you see in the morning i'll be paroling from state prison after twenty six years this spread is given to me not as like to say hey homie we appreciate you nah it was a spread to say we don't never wanna see your ass in here again and they broke out the finest of the finest top ramen chili in a can uh roast beef in a can you know this this top line of stuff right so after the spread has been had it's time for me to give away some property such as my tv my radio and some self help books that helped me a lot so they'll be better utilized left behind nine o'clock rolls around it's lights out you don't have to go to sleep but you do gotta get off the day room floor it's cool by me i'm leaving in the morning so i may have gotten like three hours worth of sleep that night i slept ready roll and that means i slept with my clothes on so once they call my name i'm out of there bye see you later so five forty five rolls around the night man says cyprien d thirty seven eighty seven five report to r and r i walk down that corridor for the last time walk the one gate after another till i get to r and r and that's receiving and release and i'm on the release end at this point i get to r and r and there's about seven to six other guys waiting for the same thing they start fingerprinting me mugshots and everything i'm cool like time to go so they load us on a van and we drive through one gate after another gate till we get to the final gate the cop says alright everybody off the van you'll step to the man at the base of the tower there and you'll give him some personal information so we did and he gave each man an envelope with two hundred dollars in it better known as gate money we all got back onto the van and drove through that last gate we made it around to the visitor's parking lot and he asked is there anyone with a ride i do i was the only one to get off the van these other guys that two hundred dollar gate money they had to spend it on buying their bus tickets maybe back to southern california or even further up north but i was the lucky one my wife was waiting there with her camera i could see her she was snapping pictures of me like a paparazzi i walk briskly towards her gave her a quick kiss whispered in her ear let's get out of here before they say we made a mistake we got in the car drove away i saw a seven eleven i was like hey babe pull over lemme i wanna go in and get something so i went in and i grabbed a pack of big red gum i hadn't had chewing gum in twenty six years big red was my favorite we got back in the car drove away we were on the road for about thirty to forty five minutes and i s i spotted a target i said hey babe that's target i saw that on the uh tv pull over lemme i wanna go in there so we did the first thing that caught my eye was how big the shopping basket was it was bigger than the space that i had to store my personal property while in prison i grabbed the basket and went down the aisle grabbing various things such as underwear socks t-shirt toothbrush toothpaste you name it i grabbed it well there goes that two hundred dollar gate money so back in the car my wife says so what do you want for dinner whoa she's stumped me with that one because for twenty six years no one had ever asked me what do i want for dinner my dinner came through a thirteen by thirteen hole in the wall you stick your hand in there and pull out a tray and what's ever on there that's what you eat so she says i know what to fix so she drove we made it to the grocery store went into the grocery store this gigantic store berkeley bowl so i made it to the produce section i'm stuck there are so many oranges to choose from and the reason and i'm stuck just looking at the oranges is because for the past ten years in prison they had taken oranges away from us because they were used to make wine so there's like a bumpy orange a smooth orange a navel orange i even met my first blood orange and at the same time this wave hit me of alone and feeling like i don't know a nervous feeling hit me like i'm the only person in this store who's paroled from a prison today after twenty six years i'm a little stuck a little so i'm looking around and i spot this ink work it's not the typical ink work that i see out here now like with colors no i know this ink work this is prison ink he has a prison guard tower on him a meltic clock with time i know that work i've seen that many times so i walk over to him and i whisper so what yard did you parole from he said oh me i got i paroled from pelican bay like four months ago i'm like and they know you got out of prison they know you on parole aw yeah they not tripping here this is berkeley man nah nobody's tripping well i walked away from him with the understanding that if he can get a job so can i so i met my wife at the checkout once again there's another stunned moment for me there are twelve checkout lines and there's somebody on the other end bagging the groceries in prison there was one window maybe thirteen by thirteen again and there was like three hundred guys waiting to get into this one window with their lists i didn't have to worry about an alarm going off or anything no getting down we're gonna get our groceries and leave out of here that was my thought cool so we made it through the made it through the checkout went back to the car got in the car and we're on the road and we come to a stoplight and this homeless guy had a sign that says anything will help so my wife reaches into the cup holder and gets ready to hand him some change and all of a sudden he gets a phone call and he tells my wife wait i gotta take this call and my thoughts was like ih if he got a cellphone i gotta get one so we drive away and my wife uh she just drives real fast right and we make it to the neighborhood just as fast as we got to the store and she pulls into the neighborhood and she points out the various neighbors' house um this is where fred and mike live the brewers live here and i'm like okay and we get to our house and she said this is us and we live at the edge of the forest i'm like cool cool and so we went inside and she gives me the grand tour and so she says well i'm gonna prepare this dinner i said cool so she made steak and lobster with small potatoes nothing out of a can folks nothing out of a packet either she made this meal we sat down we ate and i had my first glass of wine with my meal not them i'm not saying i've never had wine before i've never had wine with a meal this is some grown folks' shit i thought right so after the meal was finished we're cleaning up washing dishes my wife says you wanna get further acclimated i'm like yeah she said take out the garbage no problem i reach down tie that garbage bag up throw it over my shoulder and out to the front door i go when i open up the door no more than eight feet away from me was a ten point buck just standing there looking at me look at it standing staring at me now had we been on a prison yard me and this buck woulda had issues now i speak a lot of different gangster languages i'm fluent in crip i understand blood i even speak a little sh olo vato loco but i don't speak deer so i shut the door i call out to my wife i said hey babe there's somebody here to see you she came to the door opened it and saw there was the buck she grabbed the trashbag and walked right past it i said damn she speaks deer she came back and we both look out the door together at this buck who's still standing there just looking just majestic as could be and my wife says you don't need to trip him he's just one neighbor coming to welcome you to the neighborhood cool i thought like well the fellas aren't gonna believe this shit when i tell them this
