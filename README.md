Description of code files for clarity and reproducibility:
- code/modeling_and_evaluation.ipynb: This notebook gets the embeddings (3 different types) and trains a Ridge regression model for each (for both Subject 2 and Subject 3). It conducts a hyperparameter search over various values of alpha (regularization parameter) and gets the best model. It also conducts a more detailed evaluation to view the distribution of CC across voxels and conducts stability analysis across subjects. This notebook generates the visualizations for the CC distributions.
